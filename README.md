CSV to QDC Codebook Converter for NVivo
This is a simple, browser-based web tool to convert a codebook from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into the .qdc XML format, which is compatible for import into NVivo.

This tool is ideal for researchers and students who manage their codes in a spreadsheet and need a quick way to prepare them for a qualitative data analysis project in NVivo.

ðŸ“‹ How to Use
Prepare Your CSV File: Create a .csv file with your codes. The format must be as follows:

The first row must be a header row (e.g., "Code Name", "Description"). This row will be skipped by the converter.

Column 1: The full name of your code. This tool creates a flat list, so if you are using a numbering system for hierarchy (e.g., "1.1 External Pressure"), include it here.

Column 2: A description for the code. This field is optional.

Go to the Web Tool: Open the live tool in your web browser.

Upload Your File: Drag and drop your .csv file onto the upload area, or click to select it from your computer.

Convert and Download: Click the "Convert and Download" button. A .qdc file will be automatically downloaded to your computer.

Import into NVivo: You can now import this .qdc file directly into your NVivo project.

ðŸ”’ Privacy and Security
This tool runs entirely in your web browser using JavaScript. Your files are not uploaded to any server. The conversion process happens locally on your own computer.
